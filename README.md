# PIM Rule Writer
#### What is PIM Rule Writer?
PIM Rule Writer is a program that helps a user who is not familiar with YAML format to create PIM rules.
#### How does it work?
The program reads a CSV file and creates a PIM rule.
#### Step by step
1. Create a CSV file that you will need to create the rules.
It can have 1, 2 or 3 columns. They should be separated with ; or ,. 
Even if you don't need a CSV file for a certain rule, create an empty file 
and paste it into the project directory.
2. Compile and run the program. Answer the questions asked by the program
until it generates a YAML file with rules. 
3. Open the file and see if the rules need some additional edits. 
4. If you are sure that they are OK, import them to PIM.
5. Run and test imported rules, edit them if you need to.
